# G2Weather

G2Weather is a web application that allows users to check for current weather as well as weather forecast.

## How to use?

In the landing page there are two buttons.

* Current Location:
If you click "Current Location", the browser will prompt you for permission to get your geo-coordinates, then several results will be shown for you to choose.

* Search City:
If you click "Search City", then a search input field will appear and you can search whichever city you want, but please be specific, if there are too many search results, nothing will be shown and you will need to conduct a more specific search again.

After choosing one of the many results, another page containing current weather conditions and weather forecast will be shown.

If you wish to look for weather conditions of other cities, simply click the return button on the top left corner.
